# Project 2

## Team: Melanye, Mona, Monica, Omar, Yeon

### Articulation
As rent increases and new business increases, looking at the increase of homeless population, the migration of income levels out of cities that experience this.

* Problem Statement: Gentrification displaces poor individuals and minorities and increases homeless population
* Timeline: from 2000 to 2010
* Cities of Interest: Los Angeles, CA;  NYC, NY; Seattle, WA; Chicago, IL;

### Action items
Migration and map visualization for that 
Rent or mortgage and retail data with slider map (with dots and as rent increase, increase number of dots)
Reviewing API for walking score + crime rate 
Demolition of section 8 housing over time 
regression analysis between indicators vs reactors 

### Possible Data Sources: 
1. Migraition using CENSUS
2. Rent/Home value data
3. Crime/Walking score
4. HUD => Demolition of low income housing
5. Homeless population
6. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) (https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html)

### Possible Stories…
Slider comparing rent prices and growth of “indicator” restaurants/businesses over time
Debunking the “other side” 
Migration data from city to suburban and back again (depends on data we find) 
Start with an overarching idea 
Having a map of the united states with a slider that shows the progression of “gentrification” over time. Using the areas with drastic change as focal points, using the places with no change as control (look into the population break down) 
As rent increases and new business increases, looking at the increase of homeless population, the migration of income levels out of cities that experience this. 
Time frame: 2000-2010
For conclusion: statistical analysis of the rent and retail/business to conclude gentrification is influenced by these. 
Regression analysis
1. How rent affects migration, homelessness
2. How retail affects migration, homelessness
